# 2021 Advent of Code

My solutions for the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

Will I actually complete it this year? Probably not, but we shall see.

## Folder layout

Each days solution has its own folder `./day##/` with a complete copy of any supporting files and classes as they were when I solved the puzzle.

Any follow-up retries of a puzzle will be placed in a folder `./day##_attempt#/`

Solution folders typically contain the following:

| File               | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `input.txt`        | My input for the day's puzzle                                                                      |
| `puzzle1.py`       | The puzzle solution for part one of the day's puzzle                                               |
| `puzzle2.py`       | The puzzle solution for part two of the day's puzzle. Usually it's a modified copy of `puzzle1.py` |
| `test.txt`         | A scratch file for testing input                                                                   |
| `util.py`          | Utility library from template folder                                                               |

The `./day00/` folder holds the most up to date version of all support files. It is
updated with a copy of anything useful created during the puzzle of the day
before the next puzzle is attempted. Usually this is done not long after
commiting the day's solution.
